Dear John Doe,

A temporary password was requested for your user "john-doe" on The Things Network.

You can now go to https://eu1.cloud.thethings.network/oauth/update-password?user=john-doe&current=TEMPORARY to change your password.
Alternatively, you can use the temporary password "TEMPORARY" directly.
Please note that this temporary password can only be used to change your password, you can not use it to log in.

Your temporary password expires an hour from now, so if you don't change your password before then, you'll have to request a new temporary password if you still want to change your password.
