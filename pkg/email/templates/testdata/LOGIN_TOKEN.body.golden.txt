Dear John Doe,

A login token was requested for your user "john-doe" on The Things Network.

You can now go to https://eu1.cloud.thethings.network/oauth/token-login?token=TOKEN to log in.
Alternatively, you can use the login token "TOKEN" directly.

Your login token expires an hour from now, so if you don't log in before then, you'll have to request a new token if you still want to log in.
