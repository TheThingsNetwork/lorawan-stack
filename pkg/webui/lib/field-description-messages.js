  classCTimeoutLocation:
    'This is dependant on your exact use case. It can help to consider the following implications: timeouts that are too long can be prone to blocking communication when replies are not sent immediately. On the other hand, timeouts that are too short might miss the reply when it arrives later.',
  classCTimeoutAbsence:
    'Leave this field empty to let the network apply a default value that should be applicable for most use cases.',
  gatewayPlacementDescription:
    'Informs whether the gateway antenna is placed inside or outside. This information is used solely for display purposes, e.g. on public gateway maps (if your gateway is set as public) and has no technical or functional effects.',
  setClaimAuthCodeDescription:
    'The claim authentication code is used to transfer ownership of an end device using a process called end device claiming. Checking this checkbox will cause a claim authentication code being generated and set for each imported end device so you can eventually transfer the ownership.',

  resetMacDescription:
    'Resetting the session context and MAC state will reset the end device to its initial (factory) state. This includes resetting the frame counters and any other persisted MAC setting on the end device. Over The Air Activation (OTAA) end devices will also lose their session context. This means that such devices must rejoin the network to continue operation. Activation-by-personalization (ABP) end devices will only reset the MAC state, while preserving up/downlink queues.',
  useAdrDescription:
    'Controls whether the end device uses adaptive data rate. This will allow the network to adjust the employed data rate based on signal to noise ratio. This adaptively optimizes energy consumption, bandwidth and transmission power.',
  adrMarginDescription:
    'Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) margin in dB that is taken into account in the Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) algorithm to optimize the data rate of the end device. A higher margin requires the end device to have a better SNR before the Network Server instructs a higher data rate for the end device to use.',
  adrAckLimitDescription: 'This value changes the limit value defining the ADR back-off algorithm.',
  adrAckDelayDescription: 'This value changes the delay value defining the ADR back-off algorithm.',
  maxDutyCycleDescription:
    'The maximum aggregated transmit duty cycle of the end device over all sub-bands. The allowed time-on-air is 1/N where N is the given value: 1 is 100%, 1024 is 0.97%, etc. This value is used for traffic shaping. All end devices must respect regional regulations regardless of this value.',
  statusCountPeriodicityDescription:
    'Number of uplink messages after which the end device status is requested. Set to 0 to disable requesting the device status based on the number of uplink messages.',
  statusTimePeriodicityDescription:
    'Interval to request the end device status. Set to 0 to disable requesting the end device status on an interval.',
  skipPayloadCryptoOverrideDescription:
    'Skip payload crypto disables the application layer encryption of LoRaWAN frames. This causes the Application Server to forward the messages without any processing, such as payload formatters, to the integrations.  When doing so, the integrations are responsible for decryption and processing of the binary format in order to understand the message. This application-wide setting can be overwritten per end device.',
  basicAuthDescription:
    'To increase access security, you can choose to generate a "basic auth" authorization header to be attached to the webhook requests, if the target server requires doing so. This will authenticate the webhook requests with the defined credentials.',
  downlinkQueueInvalidated:
    'This occurs only when using LoRaWAN 1.0.x because the frame counters for the application downlinks and network downlinks are shared. Network downlinks increment this frame counter, thus rendering the queued downlinks invalid (since you cannot send two messages with the same frame counter). The Application Server will automatically handle this message as long as "Skip Payload Crypto" is not enabled.',
  filterEventDataDescription:
    'By default, the data pushed to your webhook contains a vast variety details and metadata related to the event. To avoid noise and to save bandwidth, you can filter the event data by specific paths, e.g. `up.uplink_message.decoded_payload`. Your webhook will then only receive the event data that passed the filter.',
  inputMethodDescription:
    'To register the device, we need to know the exact LoRaWAN specifications that the device adheres to. To do that, you can select your device in our extensive LoRaWAN Device Repository, which is the best way to ensure proper configuration. If your device is not listed in the repository, you can also provide versions and MAC configurations manually. Please refer to the manual and/or data sheet of your device and contact your manufacturer or reseller if you are unsure about a certain config.',
  resetsJoinNoncesDescription:
    'Allowing join nonces to be reset disables any reuse checks for the device nonces and join nonces. The join requests can be replayed indefinitely when this option is enabled. This behavior is non compliant with the LoRaWAN specifications and must not be used outside of development environments.',
  resetUsedDevNoncesDescription:
    'The device nonces ensure that join requests cannot be replayed by attackers. Resetting the device nonces enables the end device to re-use a previously used nonce. Do not use this option unless you are sure that you would like the nonces to be usable again.',
  alcsyncDescription:
    'The Application Layer Clock Synchronization package is part of the LoRa TS003 specification, it synchronizes the real-time clock of an end-device to the networkâs Global Positioning System (GPS) clock with near-second accuracy. It is useful for end-devices that do not have access to another accurate time source.',
  useDefaultNbTransDescription:
    'The number of retransmissions (NbTrans) controls how many times a frame will be transmitted over the air. The redundancy introduced by retransmissions improves the chances that a packet will be received, at the expense of more power usage. By default, depending on the number of missed frames, the same frame may be transmitted 3 times.',
  dataRateSpecificOverridesDescription:
    'Data rate specific overrides allow the number of transmissions to be limited on a per data rate basis. This may be used to limit power usage for low data rates.',
