 * Computes the structural differences (deep) between `original` and `updated`

 * @param {object} original - The original object.

 * @param {object} options - Options object.
 * @param {Array} options.exclude - A list of field names that should not be included in
 * the final diff.
 * @param {boolean} options.patchArraysItems - Whether to include diffs on arrays
 * on per element basis. If disabled changed arrays will be added in full.
 * @param {Array} options.patchInFull - Paths to only patch as a whole without traversal.
 * @returns {object} - A new object representing the structural differences
