// Validation schema of the device type repository form section.
// Please observe the following rules to keep the validation schemas maintainable:
// 1. DO NOT USE ANY TYPE CONVERSIONS HERE. Use decocer/encoder on field level instead.
//    Consider all values as backend values. Exceptions may apply in consideration.
// 2. Comment each individual validation prop and use whitespace to structure visually.
// 3. Do not use ternary assignments but use plain if statements to ensure clarity.
