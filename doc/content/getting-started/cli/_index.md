Although the web interface of {{% tts %}} (the Console) currently has support for all basic features of {{% tts %}}, for some actions, you need to use the command-line interface (CLI). The CLI allows you to manage all features of {{% tts %}}.

You can use the CLI on your local machine and on the server.

>Note: if you need help with any CLI command, use the `--help` flag to get a list of subcommands, flags and their description and aliases.
