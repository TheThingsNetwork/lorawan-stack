## Preparation

Since we're going to install {{% tts %}} using Docker and Docker Compose, follow the guides to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/#supported-platforms) and to [install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose).

Most releases contain an example `docker-compose.yml` file. You can also find this file [in the Github repository of {{% tts %}}]({{% repo-file-url "raw" "docker-compose.yml" %}}). In this guide we'll use that example `docker-compose.yml` for our deployment.
