`Components` makes reference to all the important services and tools that make the
stack lives.

This section will document the purpose and exploitation of those components. The aim is to provide
a clear understanding of the stack workflow so developers and maintainers can build upon it and contribute.

Advanced users should also go though those documents to know the full scope of possibilities.
