- term: Activation Mode
  description: "**Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA)** is the preferred and most secure way to connect a device. Devices perform a join-procedure with the network, during which a dynamic Device Address is assigned and security keys are negotiated with the device. **Activation by Personalization (ABP)** requires hardcoding the Device Address as well as the security keys in the device. This strategy might seem simpler, because you skip the join procedure, but it has downsides related to security. ABP also has the downside that devices can not switch network providers without manually changing keys in the device. **Multicast** is a virtual group of ABP devices which allows all devices to receive the same downlinks. Multicast groups do not support uplinks."

- term: Gateway
  description: Gateways form the bridge between [End Devices](#end-device) and Network Servers. Devices use low power networks like LoRa to connect to the Gateway, while the Gateway uses high bandwidth networks like WiFi, Ethernet or Cellular to connect to a Network Server.

- term: Bandwidth
  description: LoRaWAN can use channels with a bandwidth of either 125 kHz, 250 kHz or 500 kHz, depending on the region or the Frequency Plan. Making the bandwidth 2x wider (from BW125 to BW250) allows you to send 2x more bytes in the same time.

- term: Spreading Factor
  description: The transmission speed or Data Rate of a LoRaWAN message, ranging from SF7 (highest Data Rate) to SF12 (lowest Data Rate). Making the spreading factor 1 step lower (from SF10 to SF9) allows you to roughly send the same amount of data use half the time on air. Lowering the spreading factor makes it more difficult for the gateway to receive a transmission, as it will be more sensitive to noise.

  description: The LoRaWAN specification defines three device types. All LoRaWAN devices must implement Class A, whereas Class B and Class C are extensions to the specification of Class A devices.
  link: https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/classes.html

- term: Class A
  description: Class A devices support bi-directional communication between a device and a gateway. Uplink messages (from the device to the server) can be sent at any time (randomly). The device then opens two receive windows at specified times after an uplink transmission. The first receive window (Rx1) is set to 5 seconds and can be modified. The second receive window (Rx2) always comes 1 second after Rx1.
  link: https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/classes.html

- term: Class B
  description: Class B devices extend Class A by adding scheduled receive windows for downlink messages from the server. Using time-synchronized beacons transmitted by the gateway, the devices periodically open receive windows.
  link: https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/lorawan/classes.html

- term: Class C
  description: Class C devices extend Class A by keeping the receive windows open unless they are transmitting. This allows for low-latency communication but is many times more energy consuming than Class A devices.

- term: Band
  description: For LoRaWAN, a Band is a range of frequencies divided either in to dynamic channels (i.e. EU868) or fixed channels (i.e. US902, AU915). The LoRaWAN Regional Parameters specify which Bands are supported by LoRaWAN in a geographical area. Within a Band, there can be multiple complying Frequency Plans. Devices typically support one or more Bands in their hardware, and are configured for a particular Frequency Plan as part of activation.
